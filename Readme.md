# Java, Selenium, Cucumber and JUnit
* This should run on any system without changing the part. 
* Note: Minimum Java 8 required to run this demo test
* IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE also required.
* Note: I downgraded the chromedriver from 77 to 76 because most people have the 76 version on their machine.
* Important Note: Please comment out chromedriver for windows in steps/Hook class if this is going to run in mac else do nothing
